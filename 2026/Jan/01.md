# 2026-01-01

## What I did today
- Was at relatives’ house
- No focused study session

## What I learned
- Environment matters more than intention
- I need a system that survives bad days, travel, and social obligations

## Time spent
- 0 minutes (intentional reality)

## Blockers / Notes
- No private space
- Social obligations
- Acceptable exception, not an excuse

## Tomorrow's focus
- Minimum 30–45 min focused Cyfrin Updraft session
- Write and commit same day
